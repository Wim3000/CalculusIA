\maketitle


In this section, we will present several worked examples of
optimization problems. Our method for solving these problems is
essentially the following:
\begin{description}
\item[Draw a picture.] If possible, draw a schematic picture with all the relevant information. 
\item[Determine your goal.] We need identify what needs to be
  optimized.
\item[Find constraints.] What limitations are set on our
  optimization?
\item[Solve for a single variable.] Now you should have a function to optimize.
\item[Use calculus to find the extreme values.] 
\item[Verify that your extreme value corresponds to a maximum or minimum.] You can use either the Second Derivative Test or the Closed Interval Method, depending on whether there are multiple critical values or just a single critical value.
\end{description}






\begin{example}
You are making cylindrical containers to contain a given volume.  Suppose
that the top and bottom are made of a material that is $N$ times as
expensive (cost per unit area) as the material used for the lateral side of
the cylinder.  Find (in terms of $N$) the ratio of height to base radius of
the cylinder that minimizes the cost of making the containers.
\begin{explanation}
  First we draw a picture:
\begin{image}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[penColor,very thick] (0,2) ellipse (2 and .7);
\draw[very thick,penColor!20!background] (2,-2) arc (0:180:2 and .7);% top half of ellipse
\draw[very thick,penColor] (-2,-2) arc (180:360:2 and .7);% bottom half of ellipse

\draw[penColor, very thick] (2,2) -- (2,-2);
\draw[penColor, very thick] (-2,2) -- (-2,-2);

\draw[penColor, dashed, very thick] (0,2) -- (2,2);
\draw[penColor, dashed, very thick] (0,2) -- (0,-2);

\node [above,penColor] at (1,2) {$r$};
\node [left,penColor] at (0,-.33) {$h$};
\node [penColor,right] at (2,-1.42) {$V = \pi r^2h$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
  Letting $c$ represent the cost of the lateral side, we can write an
  expression for the cost of materials:
  \[
  C = 2\pi crh+\answer[given]{2\pi r^2Nc}.
  \]
  Since we know that $V=\pi r^2h$, we can use this relationship to
  eliminate $h$ (we could eliminate $r$, but it's a little easier if we
  eliminate $h$, which appears in only one place in the above formula
  for cost).  We find
\begin{align*}
  C(r)&=2c\pi r\frac{V}{\pi r^2}+2Nc\pi r^2\\
  &=\frac{2cV}{r}+2Nc\pi r^2.
\end{align*}
We want to know the minimum value of this function when $r$ is in
$(0,\infty)$. Setting
\[
C'(r)=\answer[given]{-2cV/r^2+4Nc\pi r} =0
\]
we find $r=\sqrt[3]{V/(2N\pi)}$.  Since $C''(r)=\answer[given]{4cV/r^3+4Nc\pi}$ is
positive when $r$ is positive, there is a local minimum at the
critical value, and hence a global minimum since there is only one
critical value. IMPORTANT: We can only use the Second Derivative Test to guarantee this is the global minimum because there is only one critical value. If there is more than one, this technique does not work.

Finally, since $h=V/(\pi r^2)$, 
\begin{align*}
\frac{h}{r}&=\frac{V}{\pi r^3}\\ 
&=\frac{V}{\pi(V/(2N\pi))}\\ 
&=\answer[given]{2N},
\end{align*}
so the minimum cost occurs when the height $h$ is $2N$ times the
radius. If, for example, there is no difference in the cost of
materials, the height is twice the radius.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}






\begin{example}
  You want to sell a certain number $n$ of items in order to maximize
  your profit.  Market research tells you that if you set the price at
  \$$1.50$, you will be able to sell $5000$ items, and for every $10$
  cents you lower the price below \$$1.50$ you will be able to sell
  another $1000$ items.  Suppose that your fixed costs (``start-up
  costs'') total \$$2000$, and the per item cost of production
  (``marginal cost'') is \$$0.50$.  Find the price to set per item and
  the number of items sold in order to maximize profit, and also
  determine the maximum profit you can get.
\begin{explanation}
The first step is to convert the problem into a function maximization
problem. The revenue for selling $n$ items at $x$ dollars is given by
\[
r(x) = nx
\]
and the cost of producing $n$ items is given by
\[
c(x) = 2000+0.5 n. 
\]
However, from the problem we see that the number of items sold is
itself a function of $x$,
\[
n(x) =5000+\frac{1000(1.5-x)}{0.10}
\]
So profit is give by:
\begin{align*}
P(x) &= r(x) - c(x)\\
&= nx - (2000+0.5 n)\\
&=-10000x^2+25000x-12000. 
\end{align*}
We want to know the maximum value of this function when $x$ is between
0 and $1.5$. The derivative is
\[
P'(x)=\answer[given]{-20000x+25000},
\]
which is zero when $x=1.25$. Since $P''(x)=-20000<0$, there must be a
local maximum at $x=1.25$, and since this is the only critical value
it must be a global maximum as well. Alternately, we could compute
$P(0)=-12000$, $P(1.25)=3625$, and $P(1.5)=3000$ and note that
$P(1.25)$ is the maximum of these. Thus the maximum profit is
\$$3625$, attained when we set the price at \$$1.25$ and sell $7500$
items.

   We can confirm our results by looking at the graph of $y=P(x)$:
   \[
   \graph[xmin=0,xmax=3,ymin=-4000,ymax=6000]{y=-10000x^2+25000x-12000}
   \]

\begin{example}
If you fit the largest possible cone inside a sphere, what fraction of the
volume of the sphere is occupied by the cone?  (Here by ``cone'' we mean a
right circular cone, i.e., a cone for which the base is perpendicular to
the axis of symmetry, and for which the cross-section cut perpendicular to
the axis of symmetry at any point is a circle.)

\node [penColor,left] at (-1.5,1.42) {$V_{\text{c}} = \frac{\pi r^2h}{3}$};
\node [penColor2, right] at (1.5,-1.42) {$V_{s} = \frac{4\pi R^3}{3}$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}
\begin{explanation}
Let $R$ be the radius of the sphere, and let $r$ and $h$ be the base
radius and height of the cone inside the sphere.  Our goal is to
maximize the volume of the cone: $V_c=\pi r^2h/3$.  The largest $r$
could be is $R$ and the largest $h$ could be is $2R$.

Notice that the function we want to maximize, $\pi r^2h/3$, depends on
\textit{two} variables.  Our next step is to find the relationship and
use it to solve for one of the variables in terms of the other, so as
to have a function of only one variable to maximize.  In this problem,
the condition is apparent in the figure, as the upper corner of the
triangle, whose coordinates are $(r,h-R)$, must be on the circle of
radius $R$. Write
\[
r^2 + (h-R)^2=R^2.
\] 
Solving for $r^2$, since $r^2$ is found in the formula for the volume
of the cone, we find 
\[
r^2=R^2-(h-R)^2.
\]  
Substitute this into the formula for the volume of the cone to find
\begin{align*}
 V_{\text{c}}(h)&=\pi(R^2-(h-R)^2)h/3 \\
&=-{\pi\over3}h^3+{2\over3}\pi h^2R
\end{align*}

We want to maximize $V_{\text{c}}(h)$ when $h$ is between $0$ and $2R$. Thus, we can imagine we are solving this problem on the closed interval $[0,2R]$.

We
solve 
\[
V_{\text{c}}'(h)=\answer[given]{-\pi h^2+(4/3)\pi h R}=0,
\] 
finding $h=0$ or $h=4R/3$.  We compute
\[
V_{\text{c}}(0)=V_{\text{c}}(2R)=0
\]
and
\[
V_{\text{c}}(4R/3)=(32/81)\pi R^3.
\] 

Using the Closed Inteval Method, the maximum must be the largest value in this list, which is $V_{\text{c}}(4R/3)=(32/81)\pi R^3.$.

Note that we cannot use the Second Derivative Test here because there is more than one critical value.

Since the volume of the sphere is $(4/3)\pi
R^3$, the fraction of the sphere occupied by the cone is
\[
\frac{(32/81)\pi R^3}{(4/3)\pi R^3}=\frac{8}{27}\approx 30\%.
\]

%  It costs \$50/ft. to run a power line along the land, and \$130/ft. to
%  run a power line under water. How much of the power line should be run
%  along the land to minimize the overall cost? What is the minimal cost?
%  \begin{explanation}
%    There are two immediate solutions that we could consider, each of
%    which we will reject through ``common sense.'' First, we could
%    minimize the distance by directly connecting the two locations with a
%    straight line. However, this requires that all the wire be laid
%    underwater, the most costly option. Second, we could minimize the
%    underwater length by running a wire all 5000 ft. along the beach,
%    directly across from the offshore facility. This has the undesired
%    effect of having the longest distance of all, probably ensuring a
%    nonminimal cost.
%    
%    The optimal solution likely has the line being run along the
%    ground for a while, then underwater, as the figure implies. We
%    need to label our unknown distances: the distance run along the
%    ground and the distance run underwater. Recognizing that the
%    underwater distance can be measured as the hypotenuse of a right
%    triangle, we can label our figure as follows
%      \begin{image}

%    \end{tikzpicture}
%      \end{image}
%      By choosing $x$ as we did, we make the expression under the
%      square root simple. We now create the cost function:
%    \[
%    \begin{array}{ccc}
%      \text{Cost} = & & \\
%      \text{land cost} & + & \text{water cost} \\
%      \text{\$50}\times \text{land distance} &+& \text{\$130}\times \text{water distance} \\
%      50(5000-x) &+& 130\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}.\\
%    \end{array}
%    \]
%    So we have
%    \[
%    c(x) = \answer[given]{50(5000-x)+ 130\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}}.
%    \]
%    This function only makes sense on the interval $[0,5000]$. While
%    we are fairly certain the endpoints will not give a minimal cost,
%    we still evaluate $c(x)$ at each to verify.
%    \[
%    c(0) = 380000 \quad\quad c(5000) \approx 662873.
%    \]
%    We now find the critical points of $c(x)$. We compute $c'(x)$ as
%    \[
%    c'(x) = \answer[given]{-50+\frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}}}.
%    \]
%    Recognize that this is never undefined. Setting $c'(x)=0$ and solving
%    for $x$, we have:
%    \begin{align*}
%      -50+\frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}} &= 0 \\
%      \frac{130x}{\sqrt{x^2+1000^2}}  &= 50\\
%      \frac{130^2x^2}{x^2+1000^2} &= 50^2\\
%      130^2x^2 &= 50^2(x^2+1000^2) \\
%      130^2x^2-50^2x^2 &= 50^2\cdot1000^2\\
%      (130^2-50^2)x^2 &= 50000^2\\
%      x^2 &= \frac{50000^2}{130^2-50^2}\\
%      x &= \frac{50000}{\sqrt{130^2-50^2}}\\
%      x &= \frac{50000}{120},
%    \end{align*}
%    Evaluating $c(x)$ at $x=416.67$ gives a cost of about
%    $\$370000$. The distance the power line is laid along land is
%    $5000-416.67 = 4583.33\unit{ft}$ and the underwater distance is
%    $\sqrt{416.67^2+1000^2} \approx 1083\unit{ft}$.

%  Suppose that the road is straight, and $b$ is the distance from $A$
%  to the closest point $C$ on the road.  Let $v$ be your speed on the
%  road, and let $w$, which is less than $v$, be your speed on the
%  sand.  Right now you are at the point $D$, which is a distance $a$
%  from $C$.  At what point $B$ should you turn off the road and head
%  across the sand in order to minimize your travel time to $A$?
%  \begin{explanation}
%    Let $x$ be the distance short of $C$ where you turn off, the distance
%    from $B$ to $C$.  We want to minimize the total travel time.  Recall
%    that when traveling at constant velocity, time is distance divided by
%    velocity.
%
%    You travel the distance from $D$ to $B$ at speed $v$, and then the
%    distance from $B$ to $A$ at speed $w$.  The distance from $D$ to $B$
%    is $a-x$. By the Pythagorean theorem, the distance from $B$ to $A$
%    is
%    \[
%    \sqrt{x^2+b^2}.
%    \] 
%Hence the total time for the trip is
%\[
%T(x)=\frac{a-x}{v}+\frac{\sqrt{x^2+b^2}}{w}.
%\]
%We want to find the minimum value of $T$ when $x$ is between 0 and
%$a$.  As usual we set $T'(x)=0$ and solve for $x$. Write
%\[
%  T'(x)=\answer[given]{-1/v+\frac{x}{w\sqrt{x^2+b^2}}} =0.
%\]
%We find that 
%\[
%x=\frac{wb}{\sqrt{v^2-w^2}}
%\]
%Notice that $a$ does not appear in the last expression, but $a$ is not
%irrelevant, since we are interested only in critical values that are
%in $[0,a]$, and $wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ is either in this interval or not.
%If it is, we can use the second derivative to test it:
%\[
%T''(x) = \answer[given]{\frac{b^2}{(x^2+b^2)^{3/2}w}}.
%\]
%Since this is always positive there is a local minimum at the critical
%point, and so it is a global minimum as well.
%
%If the critical value is not in $[0,a]$ it is larger than $a$. In this
%case the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints. We can compute
%\begin{align*}
%T(0)&={a\over v}+{b\over w} \\
%T(a)&={\sqrt{a^2+b^2}\over w} 
%\end{align*}
%but it is difficult to determine which of these is smaller by direct
%comparison. If, as is likely in practice, we know the values of $v$,
%$w$, $a$, and $b$, then it is easy to determine this. With a little
%cleverness, however, we can determine the minimum in general. We have seen that
%$T''(x)$ is always positive, so the derivative $T'(x)$ is always increasing.
%We know that at $wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ the derivative is zero, so for
%values of $x$ less than that critical value, the derivative is
%negative. This means that $T(0)>T(a)$, so the minimum occurs when $x=a$.
%
%So the upshot is this: If you start farther away from $C$ than
%$wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ then you always want to cut across the sand 
%when you are a distance $wb/\sqrt{v^2-w^2}$ from point $C$. If you
%start closer than this to $C$, you should cut directly across the sand.
