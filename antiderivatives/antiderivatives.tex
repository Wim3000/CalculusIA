At this point, you are able to take the derivative of almost any function you can write
down. However, undoing derivatives is much harder. This process of
undoing a derivative is called taking an \textit{antiderivative}.

\begin{definition}
A function $F$ is called an \dfn{antiderivative} of $f$ on an
interval if
\[
F'(x) = f(x)
\]
for all $x$ in the interval.
\end{definition}

    The functions $x^2$, $x^2-1.5$, $x^2+2$, $x^2+5$ and so on, are all
    antiderivatives of $2x$.
    
     It is clear that any function $x^2+C$, where $C$ is a constant, is an antiderivative of $f$. Why?
    Because, $(x^2+C)'=2x=f(x)$.
    
     Could there exist any other antiderivative of $f$, call it $G$, such that $G(x)$ is not a sum of $x^2$ and a constant?
    In that case, for all $x$  we would have
  \[
  (G(x)-x^2)' = G'(x)-2x=f(x)-2x= \answer[given]{0}\\
\]
  \end{feedback}
  Recall: Any function whose derivative is equal to $0$ on some interval is equal to a constant on that interval.
  This means that the function $G(x)-x^2=C$, for some constant $C$. This implies that $G(x)=x^2+C$, for all x.

\begin{theorem}[The Family of Antiderivatives]\label{theorem:FOA}

If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then the function $f$ has a whole \textbf{family of antiderivatives}. Each antiderivative of $f$ is the sum of $F$ and some constant $C$.
\end{theorem}

So, when we write $F(x)+C$, we denote the entire family of
antiderivatives of $f$.  Alternative notation for this family of
antiderivatives was introduced by \link[G.W.\ Leibniz]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz} (1646-1716):
 
\begin{definition}\index{antiderivative!notation}\index{indefinite integral}
Let $f$ be a function. The family of of \emph{all} antiderivatives of $f$ is denoted by
\[
\int f(x) \d x. 
\]

This is called the
\dfn{indefinite integral} of $f$.
\end{definition}
It follows that
\[
\int f(x) \d x =F(x)+C,
\]
where $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$ and $C$ is an arbitrary constant.

%Now we are ready to "integrate" some famous functions.

The basic indefinite integrals listed below are a direct consequence of our memorized derivative rules.
%Fill out these basic antiderivatives. Note each of these examples comes
%directly from our knowledge of basic derivatives.

A note about the second indefinite integral in the list above: Notice that 
\[\ln|x|=\begin{cases} \ln(-x) \mbox{ for } x<0\\\ln(x) \mbox{ for } x> 0\end{cases}.\]

Certainly from basic derivative rules we know that $\frac{d}{dx}\ln(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, but it can also be computed using the chain rule that $\frac{d}{dx}\ln(-x)=\dfrac{1}{-x}\cdot(-1)=\frac{1}{x}$ as well. Thus, since it encompasses both functions, $\ln|x|+C$ is the most general antiderivative of $\frac{1}{x}$.

It may seem that one could simply memorize these antiderivatives and then antidifferentiating would be as easy as differentiating. Unfortunately this is \textbf{not} the case because there are few direct analogues of things like the product, quotient, and chain rules. So while we \emph{can} add and subtract antiderivatives, we \emph{cannot} multiply, divide, or compose them.

%The issue comes up when trying to combine these functions. When taking derivatives we have the \textit{product rule} and the \textit{chain rule}. 

\begin{theorem}[The Sum Rule for Antiderivatives]\label{theorem:SRA}
If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ and $G$ is an antiderivative of
$g$, then $F+G$ is an antiderivative of $f+g$.

We can write equivalently, using indefinite integrals, 

\[\int \left(f(x)+g(x)\right) \d x= \int f(x)\d x +\int g(x) \d x.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  Find  an antiderivative of the function $h$ defined by expression
  
   $h(x)=\cos{x}+\frac{1}{x}$, for all $x$ in some interval $I$.
  \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{$H(x)=\cos(x)+\frac{1}{x}$}
    \choice{$H(x)=\sin(x)+\frac{1}{x^2}$}
    \choice[correct]{$H(x)=\sin(x)+\ln{x}$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
    Differentiate each choice.
    
     In the last choice we get $H'(x)=\cos(x)+\frac{1}{x}=h(x)$.
     
     Also notice that, in contrast, $\int\cos(x)+\frac{1}{x}dx=\sin(x)+\ln|x|+C$.
  \end{feedback}
\end{example}
It is easy to check an antiderivative: we just have to differentiate it, and check whether $H'(x)=h(x)$, for all $x$ in $I$.

Notice, that the function $h$ is the sum of the two functions, $f$ and $g$, where $f(x)=\cos(x)$ and $g(x)=\frac{1}{x}$, for $x$ in $I$.

We know antiderivatives of both functions:  $F(x)=\sin(x)$ and $G(x)=\ln(x)$,  for $x$ in $I$, are antiderivatives of $f$ and $g$, respectively.
So, in this example we see that the function  $F+G$ is an antiderivative of $f+g$.
%In other words, "the sum of antiderivatives is an antiderivative of a sum".

%This is true in general.

%Is this true in general? 
%
%Let's check whether this rule holds for any eligible pair of functions $f$ and $g$ defined on some interval $I$.
% \begin{question}
%Let $f$, $g$, $F$ and $G$ be four functions defined on some interval $I$ such that $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$ and $G$ is an antiderivative of $g$, i.e.
%
%$F'(x)=f(x)$ and $G'(x)=g(x)$ for all $x$ in some interval $I$.
%
%  Find an antiderivative of the function $f+g$.
%    \begin{hint}
%    Differentiate the function $F+G$.
%     \end{hint}
%     Since
%     $\left(F(x)+G(x)\right)'=F'(x)+G'(x)=f(x)+g(x)$,
%     it follows that  $F+G$ is an antiderivative of $f+g$. 
%     
% To summarize: The sum of antiderivatives is an antiderivative of a sum. 
%\end{question}
%We have proved the following theorem.



%Next, we will try to prove an analogue of the constant multiple rule for derivatives.
%Let's consider the following example.

\begin{theorem}[The Constant Multiple Rule for Antiderivatives]\label{theorem:CMRA}
If $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, and $k$ is a constant, then $kF$
is an antiderivative of $kf$.

We can write equivalently, using indefinite integrals, 
\[\int kf(x) \d x= k\int f(x)\d x.\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
  Find  an antiderivative of the function $h$, where
   $h(x)=5\sec^{2}(x)$,  for all $x$ in some interval $I$.
  \begin{multipleChoice}
  \choice[correct]{$H(x)=5\tan(x)$}
    \choice{$H(x)=5\sec^{2}(x)$}
    \choice{$H(x)=\sec^{2}(5x)$}
  \end{multipleChoice}
  \begin{feedback}
    Differentiate each choice for $H(x)$. In the first choice we get
    $H'(x)=5\sec^{2}(x)=h(x)$.
  \end{feedback}
\end{example}
%It is easy to check an antiderivative: we just have to differentiate it, and check whether $H'(x)=h(x)$, for all $x$ in $I$.

%Notice, in this example the function $h$ is a constant multiple of $f$, 
%
%where $f(x)=\sec^{2}{x}$. On the other hand, we know that the function $F$, defined by 
%$F(x)=\tan{x}$ is an antiderivative of $f$.
%If we  differentiate the function $5F$, we get that
%
%  $\left(5F(x)\right)'=\left(5\tan{x}\right)'=5\left(\tan{x}\right)'=5\sec^{2}{x}=5f(x)$, for $x$ in $I$.
%  
%This is always true: a constant multiple of an antiderivative is an antiderivative of a constant multiple of a function.



%Is this always true?
%
%Let's check whether this rule holds for  any constant $k$ and any eligible  function $f$ defined on some interval $I$.
% \begin{question}
%Let $k$ be a constant, let $f$ be a function defined on some interval $I$ and let $F$ be an antiderivative of $f$, i.e.
%
%$F'(x)=f(x)$, for all  $x$ in some interval $I$.
%
%  Find an antiderivative of the function $k f$.
%    \begin{hint}
%    Differentiate the function $kF$.
%     \end{hint}
%     Since $\left(kF(x)\right)'=kF'(x)=kf(x)$, it follows that $kF$ is
%     an antiderivative of $kf$.
% To summarize: The constant multiple of an antiderivative is an antiderivative of a constant multiple of a function. 
%\end{question}
%We have proved the following theorem.

Let's put these rules and our knowledge of basic derivatives to work.
\begin{example}
Find the antiderivative of $3 x^7$.
\begin{explanation}
	By the theorems above , we see that
\begin{align*}
\int 3 x^7 \d x &= 3 \int x^7 \d x\\
&= 3 \cdot \answer[given]{\frac{x^8}{8}}+C.
\end{align*}
\end{explanation}
\end{example}
The sum rule for antiderivatives allows us to integrate
term-by-term. Let's see an example of this.

\begin{example}
Compute:
\[
\int \left(x^4 + 5x^2 - \cos(x)\right) \d x
\]
\begin{explanation}
Let's start by simplifying the problem using the sum rule 
 and constant multiple rule for antiderivatives, 
\begin{align*}
\int &\left(x^4 + 5x^2 - \cos(x)\right) \d x\\
&= \int x^4 \d x + 5\int x^2 \d x - \int \cos(x) \d x.
\end{align*}
Now we may integrate term-by-term to find
\[
= \answer[given]{\frac{x^5}{5} + \frac{5x^3}{3}  - \sin(x)}+C.
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}


\begin{warning}
While the sum rule for antiderivatives allows us to integrate
term-by-term, we cannot integrate \textit{factor-by-factor}, meaning
that in general
\[
\int f(x)g(x) \d x \ne \int f(x) \d x\cdot \int g(x) \d x.
\]
\end{warning}


\begin{example}
  A classmate claims that $\int 2x \cos(x) \d x = x^2 \sin(x) +C$. Is this correct?
  
  \begin{explanation}
    If the student were correct, then the derivative of $x^2 \sin(x) +C$ with respect to $x$ would have to be $2x \cos(x)$.  However:
    
      \[\ddx x^2 \sin(x) = \answer[given]{2x \sin(x) +x^2 \cos(x)} \]
      
So the classmate is incorrect!
  \end{explanation}
\end{example}


\section{Algebraic simplification}


Each antiderivative problem is a sort of puzzle. Later we will learn a
hand-full of techniques for computing antiderivatives. In the meantime, we can rely on our memorized derivative rules, the Sum Rule, the Constant Multiple Rule, and simplifying.


%
%\paragraph{Tips for guessing antiderivatives}
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item If possible, express the function that you are integrating in a form that is convenient for integration.
%\item Make a guess for the antiderivative.
%\item Take the derivative of your guess.
%\item Note how the above derivative is different from the function
%  whose antiderivative you want to find.
%\item Change your original guess by \textbf{multiplying} by constants
%  or by \textbf{adding} in new functions.
%\end{enumerate}



\begin{example}
Compute:
\[
\int \frac{\sqrt{x}+1+x}{x} \d x
\]
\begin{explanation}
We don't have an integration rule for a quotient, but we can simplify this integrand. 
\begin{align*}
  \int \frac{\sqrt{x}+1+x}{x} \d x &=\int \left(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{x}+\frac{1}{x}+\frac{x}{x}\right) \d x\\
  &=\int \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}+\frac{1}{x}+1\right) \d x\\
  &=\int \left(x^{-\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{x}+1\right) \d x
\end{align*}
Now, we can apply the Sum Rule.
\[
\int \left(x^{-\frac{1}{2}}+\frac{1}{x}+1\right) \d x=\int x^{-\frac{1}{2}}\d x+\int\frac{1}{x}\d x+\int1 \d x
\]
Now we can finish the problem.
\[
\int \frac{\sqrt{x}+1+x}{x} \d x= \answer[given]{2}\sqrt{x}+\ln{x}+ \answer[given]{x} + C.
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
Compute:
\[
\int \sqrt{x}(x^3+1) \d x
\]
\begin{explanation}
We don't have an integration rule for a product, but we can simplify this integrand. 
\begin{align*}
  \int \sqrt{x}(x^3+1) \d x &=\int x^{7/2}+x^{1/2} \d x\\
\end{align*}
Now, we can apply the Power Rule, which is the third Basic Antiderivative Rule.
\[
\int x^{7/2}+x^{1/2} \d x= \dfrac{\answer[given]{x^{9/2}}}{9/2}+ \frac{x^{3/2}}{\answer[given]{3/2}} + C.
\]
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

%\begin{example}
%  Compute:
%  \[
%  \int \cos{(4x)} \d x
%  \]
%  \begin{explanation}
%    Start with a guess of 
%    \[
%    \int \cos{(4x)} \d x \approx \sin{(4x)}.
%    \]
%    Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%    \[
%    \ddx  \sin{(4x)} = 4 \cos{(4x)}.
%    \]
%    We're off by a factor of $\frac{1}{4}$, so multiply your guess by this constant
%    to get the solution,
%    \[
%  \int \cos{(4x)} \d x = \answer[given]{\frac{1}{4}\sin{(4x)}}+C.
%    \]
%\end{explanation}
%\end{example}
%\begin{example}
%  Compute:
%  \[
%  \int 3x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)} \d x
%  \]
%  \begin{explanation}
%    Start with a guess of 
%    \[
% \int 3x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)} \d x \approx -\cos{(x^3 -6)}.
%    \]
%    Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%    \[
%    \ddx \left(-\cos{(x^3 -6)}\right) = 3x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)}.
%    \]
%   Therefore,
%    \[
%    \int 3x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)} \d x
% =- \cos{(\answer[given]{x^3 -6})}+C.
%    \]
%\end{explanation}
%\end{example}
%
%\begin{example}
%  Compute:
%  \[
%  \int x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)} \d x
%  \]
%  \begin{explanation}
%    Start with a guess of 
%    \[
% \int x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)} \d x \approx -\cos{(x^3 -6)}.
%    \]
%    Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%    \[
%    \ddx \left(-\cos{(x^3 -6)}\right) = 3x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)}.
%    \]
%    We're off by a factor of $1/3$, so multiply our guess by this constant
%    to get the solution,
%    \[
%    \int x^2\sin{(x^3 -6)} \d x
% =- \answer[given]{\frac{1}{3}}\cos{(x^3 -6)}+C.
%    \]
%\end{explanation}
%\end{example}
%
%\begin{example}
%  Compute:
%  \[
%  \int \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^4 -6}} \d x
%  \]
%  \begin{explanation}
%    Start by rewriting the indefinite integral as
%    \[
%    \int x^3\left(x^4 -6\right)^{-1/2} \d x.
%    \]
%    Now start with a guess of 
%    \[
%    \int x^3\left(x^4 -6\right)^{-1/2} \d x \approx \left(x^4 -6\right)^{1/2}.
%    \]
%    Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%    \[
%    \ddx  \left(x^4 -6\right)^{1/2} = (4/2)x^3\left(x^4 -6\right)^{-1/2}.
%    \]
%    We're off by a factor of $2/4$, so multiply our guess by this constant
%    to get the solution,
%    \[
%    \int \frac{x^3}{\sqrt{x^4 -6}} \d x = \answer[given]{\frac{1}{2}}(x^4 -6)^{1/2}+C.
%    \]
%\end{explanation}

%\int xe^{x^2} \d x
%\]
%\begin{explanation}
%We try to guess the antiderivative. Start with a guess of

%\]
%Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%\[
%\ddx e^{x^2} = 2xe^{x^2} .
%\]
%Ah! So we need only multiply our original guess by $\frac{1}{2}$.  We now
%find
%\[
%\int xe^{x^2} \d x =\answer[given]{\frac{1}{2}}e^{x^2} + C.
%\]
%\end{explanation}
%\end{example}
%\begin{example}
%Compute:
%\[
%\int \frac{21x^2}{7x^3 + 3} \d x
%\]
%\begin{explanation}
%We notice that the numerator is the derivative of the denominator, i.e., the function that we are integrating has the form $\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}$.
%\[
%\int \frac{21x^2}{7x^3 + 3} \d x = \ln(7x^3+3).
%\]
%Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%\[
%\ddx \ln(7x^3+3) = \frac{21x^2}{7x^3 + 3}.
%\]
%Therefore,

%\]
%\begin{explanation}
%We'll start with a guess of
%\[
%\int \frac{2x^2}{7x^3 + 3} \d x \approx \ln(7x^3+3).
%\]
%Take the derivative of your guess to see if it is correct:
%\[
%\ddx \ln(7x^3+3) = \frac{21x^2}{7x^3 + 3}.
%\]
%We are only off by a factor of $2/21$, so we need to multiply our
%original guess by this constant to get the solution,
%\[

\section{Differential Equations}

A \textit{differential equation}\index{differential equation} is
simply an equation with a derivative in it. Here is an example:
\[
a\cdot f'(x)+ b\cdot f(x) = g(x). 
\]
\begin{question}
	Which one is a differential equation?
	\begin{multipleChoice}
		\choice{$x^2+3x-1=0$}
		\choice[correct]{$f'(x)=x^2+3x-1$}
		\choice{$f(x)=x^2+3x-1$}  
	\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

The solutions to differential equations are functions, not numbers.
%When we solve a differential equation, they are finding\textit{functions} satisfying the equation.
\begin{question}
	Which of the following functions solve the differential equation
	\[
	f'(x) = f(x)?
	\]
	\begin{selectAll}
		\choice{$f(x) = \sin(x)$}
		\choice{$f(x) = x^2$}
		\choice[correct]{$f(x) = e^x$}
		\choice[correct]{$f(x) =6 e^x$}
		\choice{$f(x) = e^{-x}$}
		\choice{$f(x) = \tan(x)$}
	\end{selectAll}
\end{question}
\begin{remark}
	We can directly check that any function $f(x)=Ce^x$ is a solution to our differential equation $f'(x)=f(x)$. Could there be any others? It turns out that these are the \textit{only} solutions. But showing that we didn't miss any is a bit tricky.
%	\begin{expandable}
%		\begin{explanation}
%			Well, suppose we have some mysterious function $f$ and all we know is that $f'(x)=f(x)$. Let's define a new function $g(x)=f(x)/e^x$. Since our denominator is never 0, the quotient rule tells us that
%			\[
%			g'(x)= \frac{e^x f'(x)- f(x) e^x}{(e^x)^2} = \frac{e^x\left(f'(x)- f(x)\right)}{(e^x)^2} = \frac{e^x\cdot 0}{(e^x)^2}=0.
%			\]
%			But we know that a function with a 0 derivative is constant, so $g(x)=C$. Plugging this back into our formula for $g(x)$ tells us that $C=f(x)/e^x$. Now we rearrange to get $f(x)=Ce^x$.
%			
%			This shows us that any solution to our differential equation \textit{must} be one of the functions we've already found. Our argument relies on some features that are special to this problem; proving that we've found all the possible solutions to an arbitrary differential equation is a very difficult task!   
%		\end{explanation} 
%	\end{expandable}
\end{remark}

A function $Ce^x$ is called a \dfn{general solution} of the differential equation. Since there are infinitely many solutions to a differential equation, we can impose an additional condition (say $f(0)=1$), called an \dfn{initial condition}. When we are asked to find a function $f$ that satisfies both the differential equation (DE) and the initial condition (IC), this is called an \dfn{initial value problem} (IVP). Let's try one out.
\begin{example}
	Solve the initial value problem (IVP):
	\begin{align*}
		f'(x) & = f(x) && \text{(DE)}  \\
		f(0) & = 1 && \text{(IC)} 
	\end{align*}
	\begin{explanation}
		The figure below shows several solutions of the differential equation. 
		\begin{image}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
			\begin{axis}[
			domain=-3:3,
			xmin=-3, xmax=3,

			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {2*e^x};
			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {-2*e^x};
			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {-e^x};
			\addplot [color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(0,1)};  %% closed hole 
			\node at (axis cs:1.6,2.3) [penColor] {$f(x)=e^x$};
			\node at (axis cs:2.25,-5) [penColor2] {$y=-e^x$};
			\node at (axis cs:0.25,-5) [penColor2] {$y=-2e^x$};
			\node at (axis cs:0.54,5.5) [penColor2] {$y=2e^x$};
			\end{axis}
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{image}
		The figure suggests that the only solution to the initial value problem is the function $f(x)=e^x$.
		We can verify this result.
		
		Since all solutions of the differential equation have the form $f(x)=Ce^x$ and $f(0)=1$, it follows that 
		\[
		Ce^0 = 1.
		\]
		Therefore,
		\[
		C = \answer[given]{1}.
		\]
		So, the \textbf{unique} solution to the given initial value problem is the function $f(x)=e^x$.
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Solve the initial value problem (IVP):
	\begin{align*}
		f'(x) & = \sin{x}  \\
		f(0) & = -1 
	\end{align*}
	\begin{explanation}
		First, we have to solve the differential equation. The solution is clearly an antiderivative of $\sin{x}$.
		\[
		f(x)=-\answer[given]{\cos{x}}+C,
		\]
		where $C$ is an arbitrary constant. We have found the general solution of the DE  and this family of solutions is illustrated by the figure below. 
		\begin{image}
			\begin{tikzpicture}
			\begin{axis}[
			domain=-3:3,
			xmin=-3, xmax=3,
			ymin=-3, ymax=3,
			axis lines =middle, xlabel=$x$, ylabel=$y$,
			every axis y label/.style={at=(current axis.above origin),anchor=south},
			every axis x label/.style={at=(current axis.right of origin),anchor=west},]
			\addplot [very thick, penColor, smooth] {-cos(deg(x))};
			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {1-cos(deg(x))};
			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {3-cos(deg(x))};
			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {2-cos(deg(x))};
			\addplot [very thick, penColor2, smooth] {-1-cos(deg(x))};
			\addplot [color=penColor,fill=penColor,only marks,mark=*] coordinates{(0,-1)};  %% closed hole 
			\node at (axis cs:0,-1.1) [penColor] {$f(x)=-\cos{x}$};
			\node at (axis cs:0,-2.2) [penColor2] {$y=-\cos{x}-1$};
			\node at (axis cs:0.2,-0.1) [penColor2] {$y=-\cos{x}+1$};
			\node at (axis cs:0,0.9) [penColor2] {$y=-\cos{x}+2$};
			\node at (axis cs:0,1.8) [penColor2] {$y=-\cos{x}+3$};
			\node at (axis cs:0.54,5.5) [penColor2] {$y=2e^x$};
			\end{axis}
			\end{tikzpicture}
		\end{image}
		Now we must find the solution that also satisfies the initial condition 
		$f(0)=-1$.
		
		Since
		\[
		f(0)=\answer[given]{-1}+C,
		\]
		it follows that
		\[
		-1=\answer[given]{-1}+C.
		\]
		Therefore,
		\[
		C=\answer[given]{0}.
		\]
		The function 
		\[
		f(x)=\answer[given]{-\cos{x}}.
		\]
		is the solution of the initial value problem and it is shown in the figure above.
	\end{explanation}
\end{example}


\section{Application: Falling Objects}
We've established that a \dfn{differential equation} is simply an equation with a derivative in it.
When a mathematician solves a differential equation, they are finding
a \textit{function} that satisfies the equation.


Consider a falling object. Recall that the acceleration due to gravity is about $-9.8$
m/s$^2$ or about $-32$ ft/s$^2$. For now we will assume we are using meters. Since the first derivative of the velocity function 
is the acceleration and the
second derivative of a position function 
is the acceleration, we have the differential equations
\begin{align*}
v'(t) &=  -9.8,\\
s''(t) &=  -9.8.
\end{align*}
From these simple equations, in the example below we can derive expressions for the velocity
and for the position of the object using antiderivatives.


\begin{example}
A ball is tossed into the air with an initial velocity of $15$
m/s. What is the velocity of the ball after 1 second? How about after
2 seconds?
\begin{explanation}
Knowing that the acceleration due to gravity is $-9.8$ m/s$^2$, we write
\[
v'(t) = \answer[given]{-9.8}.
\]
To solve this differential equation, take the antiderivative of both sides
\begin{align*}
\int v'(t) \d t &= \int \answer[given]{-9.8} \d t\\
v(t) &= \answer[given]{-9.8 t} + C.
\end{align*}
 Since it is
tossed up with an initial velocity of $15$ m/s, 
\[
\answer[given]{15} = v(0) = -9.8\cdot 0 + C,
\]
and we see that $C=\answer[given]{15}$. Therefore, $C$ represents the initial velocity of the ball.
Hence $v(t) = -9.8t + 15$. 

Now when $t=1$,
$v(1) = 5.2$ m/s, and the ball is rising, and at $t=2$, $v(2) = -4.6$ m/s,
and the ball is falling.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

Now let's do a similar problem, but instead of finding the velocity,
we will find the position.

\begin{example}
A ball is tossed into the air with an initial velocity of $15$ m/s
from a height of 2 meters. When does the ball hit the ground?
\begin{explanation}
Knowing that the acceleration due to gravity is $-9.8$ m/s$^2$, we write
\[
v'(t) = \answer[given]{-9.8}.
\]
Start by taking the antiderivative of both sides of the equation
\begin{align*}
\int v'(t) \d t &= \int \answer[given]{-9.8} \d t\\
v(t) &= \answer[given]{-9.8 t} + C.
\end{align*}
Here $C$ represents the initial velocity of the ball. Since it is
tossed up with an initial velocity of $15$ m/s, $C = 15$ and 
\[
v(t) = -9.8t + 15.
\]
Since the velocity is the derivative of the position, we can write, alternatively
\[
s'(t) = -9.8t + 15.
\]
Now let's take the antiderivative again. 
\begin{align*}
\int s'(t) \d t &= \int \answer[given]{-9.8t +15} \d t\\
s(t) &= \answer[given]{\frac{-9.8t^2}{2} + 15t} + D.
\end{align*}
Since we know the initial height was $2$ meters, write
\[
2 = s(0) =  \frac{-9.8\cdot 0^2}{2} + 15\cdot 0 + D.
\]
Hence $s(t) = \frac{-9.8t^2}{2} + 15t + 2$. We need to know when the
ball hits the ground, this is when $s(t)=0$. Solving the equation
\[
\frac{-9.8t^2}{2} + 15t + 2 = 0
\]
we find two solutions $t\approx -0.1$ and $t\approx 3.2$. Discarding
the negative solution, we see the ball will hit the ground after
approximately $3.2$ seconds.
\end{explanation}
\end{example}

The power of calculus is that it frees us from rote memorization of
formulas and enables us to derive what we need.
